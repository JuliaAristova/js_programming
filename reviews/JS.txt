Statically Type programming langusages - type safety, 
when variable is declared you indicate data type and it cannot be changed.
Data type is translated yo binary code by compiler during compilation.

- Java
- C#
- TypeScript
- C++

Example: 
int score;

Dynamically Type languages - data type can be changed.
These programming languages using Interpreter. 
Interpeter translate to binary code during the runtime.

- JavaScript
- Python
Example: 
let score;      -- not indication on data type

ASYNCHRONOUSE - PROMISE 

Promise represents a value that will be available either now, or
in the Future, or never

Task01: 10 seconds
Step1: Make a promise to the value
Step2
Step3
Step4
Step5
Step6 ==> return the value

Task02: 7 seconds
Step1

Step3
Step4: Needs the valie that Task01 is returning ==> waits for the promised value
Step5

Task03: 5 seconds

Step4

Task04: 6seconds
